# Analysis of Machine Learning Results

This contains the notebooks for analyzing the machine learning results.

## Running these notebooks

Ideally the four scripts in the parent directory `ml` should be run before running any of these.
However, they can be run with the following dependences

### Dependencies

The following files can be run after the given pairent scripts.
